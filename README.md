## Purpose of Analysis

With the possible idea of brining a Citibike like service to Des Moines, I was asked to pull together a Tableau Story with the data Citibike makes available to the public. With this data we looked at the bike sharing informaiton from August 2019 in New York City. This data will give insights into how this may work in Des Moines.

With the NYC August data, I was able to pull together seveal reports and visuals
  1) Checkout Times by User
  2) Checkout Times by Gender
  3) Daily Trips per Weekday by Hour
  4) Daily Trips per Weekday by Hour/Gender
  5) User Trips by Gender and Weekday
  6) Peak August Hours
  7) Bike Start and End Locations

The Tableau Story is available here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicholas8669/viz/NYCCitiBikeAugustReview/NYCAugustCitibikeAnalysis?publish=yes

## Story Visuals

### Checkout Times by User

![Checkout Times by User](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100856534/175827334-3dcbc490-87fa-4f2a-bb89-dafe642270c4.png)

This reports shows us how many bikes were used per hour in a day over the month of August. Not shown in the report was the total trips in August, which number close to 2.35 million. The report above shows how those trips are spread out throughout the day.

### Checkout Times by Gender

This data in this visual is the same as the previous report, however, the data is now represted by gender instead of total users. As can be seen, the majority of the bike usage in August 2019 were Male. 

### Daily Trips per Weekday by Hour

The data pulled was organized to show the hours and weekdays. Doing show a heatmap was created to show what times and days were most popular with the bikes being used. This data shows us that Thursday from 5PM to 6PM were the most popular time to use the bikes in August 2019. 

### Daily Trips per Weekday by Hour/Gender

As what we did with checkout times we pulled the daily trips with gender review as well. As with the checkout times report, male users are represented more in this August 2019 data. The Thrusday times of 5-6PM are still represented as the most popular times. The other two genders, female and unknown, are less represented in the data, but you can see that with the female users, the typical rush hour times the bikes are used more. 

### User Trips by Gender and Weekday

Upon review it was deemed important to see what type of user was riding these bikes in August. By user I am refering to hose that subscribe to this service, or Subscribers, or all other users, known as Customers. This too was also represented by gender. Here we can see that those who subscribe represnt most of the usage of these bikes. 

### Peak August Hours

The bar graph represented on this visual shows us what the peak hours were for bike usage. As shown in previous reports the rush hour times represent most of the bike usage, but the most usage is from 5-6 PM. This report also shows us the gender breakdown per hour. 

### Bike Start and End Locations

**Bike End Locations**

Using the bike trip counts and geogrpahical data available we can determine what areas the Citibikes are used. The above reports are currently set to show us all of the data available to use in the dataset. However, these can be filtered to show us a certain range. For example, using the bike starty locations if we filter these reports to the locations with 10,000 or more bike users you can see more firect informaiton of what neighborhoods these bikes are being used.

## Report Summary

As expected with the NYC Citibike data this bike sharing system is quite popular. However, we looked at a peak summer month in New York, what does the remainder of the year result in. New York does experience winter as well as other weather events. Doing a continued review of other months may bring additional clarity on the wish to bring a bike sharing system to Des Moines.
